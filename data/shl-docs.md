### Detail Content
Description
As part of Contact Center Simulations, the Customer Service Phone Solution includes a contact center simulation and two behavioral tests designed to measure a wide range of skills, competencies, and behavioral tendencies relevant for contact center jobs. The Contact Center Simulation provides an opportunity for candidates to interact with simulated customers in a contact center environment. Designed to measure a candidate’s ability to listen attentively to the customer, take ownership of customer issues, resolve issues, navigate to find information, and enter information accurately, the Contact Center Simulation is intended to measure how a candidate will respond in a variety of customer situations and assess the candidate’s computer skills in a contact center setting. The behavioral tests in this solution are intended to measure the candidate’s learning potential and the tendency to meet goals and work hard, even when faced with obstacles. Collectively, the assessments in this solution measure a wide range of important skills, abilities, and behaviors for entry-level contact center roles.

- **Remote Testing:** yes
- **Adaptive/IRT:** no
- **Test Tab:** A C P 

### Detail Content
Description
The PJM Report provides a clear indication of each candidate's "degree of fit" to a role.  Provides targeted assessment results that match individuals with jobs . Links the essential/desirable competencies for a specific job with an individual’s competency potential. Provides an overall Match (or fit) Score useful in ranking/sorting candidates for selection 
and/or development (e.g. Talent Audit).  It provides a highly visual profile of a candidate's strengths and limitations against identified required competencies. Includes a summary table that enables prioritisation of action planning for development of critical competencies for an individual (by tabling Competency Potential against Job Importance for the role). It includes highly descriptive statements about a candidate's strengths and development  needs/limitations. 
The extended report versions include proposed competency-based interview questions 
to enable probing of specific situations in which the candidate might have 
demonstrated critical job behaviours. 
  
The PJM Report is designed for use by line managers and HR professionals in selection and 
development situations. It is valuable for identifying an individual's overall fit as well as likely areas of 
strength and weakness relative to their behaviour at work. 
 
In a selection context, this information can be used: For making interviewers aware of the areas that may need further probing. As a basis for suggesting and creating relevant interview questions. For identifying the relative strengths and weaknesses of shortlisted candidates.

### Detail Content
Description
The Retail Sales and Service Simulation measures the ability of a candidate to choose effective sales and service techniques while interacting with customers. Situations are presented to the candidate via computer-based animation, and the candidate is offered a set of behaviors from which to choose the most and least effective responses. The behaviors vary in the extent to which the sales associate may: direct a conversation toward a commitment or sale, listen carefully to customers and provide options that address what they really need/want, put aside work to assist a customer, and focus on meeting customer needs. Responses are tracked and compared against expert ratings of effectiveness. The test produces an overall score, as well as scores on two subscales, Customer Service Effectiveness and Sales Effectiveness.

Description
SHL 360, or the Multi-Rater Feedback System (‘MFS’), provides a holistic 360-degree view of an employee by gathering feedback from the employee’s manager, peers, direct reports, and/or other raters.  By offering a wide range of perspectives, 360 feedback gives employees a more thorough understanding of not only their strengths, weaknesses, and development opportunities, but also their impact on others.  360-degree multi-rater assessments are based on SHL’s Universal Competency Framework (“UCF”), using our proven library of research-driven competencies to provide opportunities for managers, peers, and direct reports to supply useful developmental feedback that they may not otherwise share.  SHL can also offer support and training throughout the entire process, from defining objectives through interpreting and delivering the feedback.  360 feedback serves all levels and industries and is a positive and powerful addition to your performance management system.
